1. Dataset includes population and three manufacturering center of test kits and their avarage distance (mile) to each state and the capacity of three manufacturing center of test kits.

2. Formulated the problem as a linear program and implemented the dual problem.

3. Implemented the linear programing model and sensitivity report in python to determine the optimal solutions with minimized total costs of testing kitsâ€™ production and distribution for Coronavirus (COVID-19) in U.S
